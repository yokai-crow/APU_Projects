                    <p class="font1">Rock climbing has come out as one of the adventure sport and outdoor activity among the adventure lovers across the world. It is is an adventurous & challenging sport for outdoor lovers, in which participants climb up or across natural rock
                        formations or man-made rock walls with the goal of reaching the summit of a formation or the endpoint of a pre-defined route. Rock climbing is similar to scrambling (another activity involving the scaling of hills and similar formations),
                        but climbing is generally differentiated by its need for the use of the climber's hands to hold his or her own weight and not just provide balance. Rock climbing is a physically and mentally demanding sport, one that often tests a climber's
                        strength, endurance, agility, and balance along with his or her mental control. It can be a dangerous sport and knowledge of proper climbing techniques and usage of specialized climbing equipment is crucial for the safe completion of routes.</p>
                    <br/>
                        <p class="font1">Mostly we focus in rock climbing in Nepal. Rock Climbing in Nepal is a hobby sport in which participants climb up or across natural rock formations or man-made climbing walls. Rock climbing is a physically and mentally demanding sport, one
                        that often tests a climber's strength, endurance, agility, and balance along with his or her mental control. It can be a dangerous sport and knowledge of proper climbing techniques and usage of specialized climbing equipment is crucial
                        for the safe completion of routes.</p>
                    <br/>
                        <p class="font1">Most of the climbing done in modern times is considered free climbing—climbing using one's own physical strength, with equipment used solely as protection and not as support—as opposed to aid climbing, the gear-dependent form of climbing that
                        was dominant in the sport's earlier days. Free climbing is typically divided into several styles that differ from one another depending on the choice of equipment used and the configurations of their belay, rope and anchor systems.</p>
                    <br/>
                        <p class="font1">As routes get higher off the ground, the increased risk of life-threatening injuries necessitates additional safety measures. A variety of specialized climbing techniques and climbing equipment exists to provide that safety. Climbers will
                        usually work in pairs and utilize a system of ropes and anchors designed to catch falls. Ropes and anchors can be configured in different ways to suit many styles of climbing, and roped climbing are thus divided into further sub-types
                        that vary based on how their belay systems are set up. Generally speaking, beginners will start with top roping and/or easy bouldering and work their way up to lead climbing and beyond. Due to the length of time and extended endurance
                        required, and because accidents are most likely to happen on the descent, rock climbers do not usually climb back down the route, or "downclimb," especially on the larger multiple pitch class III–IV, or multi-day grade IV–VI climbs</p>
                    <br/>
                        <p class="font1">Rock Climbing is a recent addition to Nepal’s adventure activity list, which has put us on the world rock climbing list of places to visit. Though it’s a new development in the tourist industry, actually it is not new to Nepal; 
                        the sport has been around since the time of the first mountaineers’ way back in the early 1950s. NMA Secretary, Mr. Ang Karma Sherpa explain that “Rock Climbing in Nepal is not new, but what is new in our context is evolution as a separate sport.” 
                        Being the latest adventure, for the promotion of rock climbing the NMA has worked out a long term plan for it. The aim of NMA is to popularize the spot among Nepalese youth and prepare a crew of international standard to take part in Olympiad and 
                        other international events to promote Nepal as a rock climber’s destination.<br/>
                        Rock climbing spots are situated to the north and northwest of the valley. Kathmandu has a roster of stone walls which creates a chance for you to practice and hone your skills before taking on the real thing. Nagarjun, Balaju, Shivapuri and 
                        Budhanilakantha are the best places around Kathmandu where you can climb the rock faces. Climbing trips can be incorporated with bird watching, game watching and experiencing some of the last of the valley’s wild places. Nagarjun and Shivapuri 
                        hills have some excellent cliffs for you to climb. Both places are just a stone’s throw away from the city.</p>
