                <p> 
                    Everest Base Camp Trek is the bucket-list adventure for many trekkers and adventurers. Far from the ordinary bustle, this majestic trek introduces you to different levels of challenges.

                    Sitting under the shades of the Khumbu Glacier, Everest Base Camp is one of the world’s most symbolic landmarks. The EBC trek is an adventure that takes you closest to the Himalayas you have ever been.

                    The journey to experience the beauty of this adventure dates a long way back. Sir Edmund Hilary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa were the first to scale the summit of Mount Everest in 1953. Since the first successful 
                    expedition, hundreds of travelers visit Nepal every year to catch a glimpse of the Himalayas.

                <p>
                    The 16-day Everest Base Camp Trek is not a regular tour but an experience of a lifetime. This classic tour takes you along the rugged Himalayan trails, decorated with snow-capped pinnacles, snowy glaciers, and Sherpa 
                    heritage. It introduces you to some of the world's highest mountains, including Mount Everest, Lhotse, Nuptse, Ama Dablam, and Cho Oyu, to name a few. Besides, you get to witness the rustic lifestyle of the Sherpas and enjoy their famed hospitality.

                    Your journey to the EBC begins with a scenic flight from Kathmandu to Lukla. Running only 527 meters long, the Tenzing-Hillary Airport has one of the shortest runways in the world. The 40-minute flight to this tiny 
                    airstrip is an adventure in itself. On a clear day, you can witness the lush green Himalayan landscapes and the mighty mountain ranges from the tiny window of the aircraft.

                <p>
                    Upon landing at the Tenzing-Hillary Airport, you'll begin the trek along the narrow alleyways of Lukla. The walk is reasonably easy and gradual on the bank of the Dudh Koshi River. After walking past several Sherpa villages, including Phakding, Benkar, 
                    and Jorsalle, you'll arrive at Namche Bazaar, the gateway to the Himalayas.

                    After acclimatizing at Namche, you'll continue your journey along the pine forest to Tengboche. Here, you'll get to visit Khumbu's largest monastery and witness the spiritual aspect of this land. The village of Tengboche also offers a stunning view of 
                    Ama Dablam, Mt. Everest, and Nuptse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You'll continue your trek to Dingboche, walking past several villages, mani walls, and chortens with the view of Ama Dablam in the backdrop. Located at 4410 meters, Dingboche will be your second acclimatization stop after Namche Bazaar. On the leisure day, 
                    you'll be hiking to the nearby Nagarjun Hill to relish the surrounding mountains of the Everest region.

                    After acclimatizing to the thin air, you'll be heading toward Lobuche. The trail becomes a bit drier, and the mountains look fairly closer as you walk past the ancient stone-walled villages. En-route Lobuche, you'll also cross Thukla Pass decorated in stone 
                    shrines and memorials of the fallen climbers.
                    
                    After that, you’ll be walking along the moraine of Khumbu Glacier towards Gorak Shep. Trodding through the rocky terrains past Gorak Shep, you'll reach your ultimate destination at Everest Base Camp.
                    
                    Early next morning, you'll be hiking to Kala Patthar, a gray-green cliff right beneath Mt. Pumori. This famous viewpoint at 5545 meters marks the highest elevation point of the 16-day Everest Base Camp Trek. From the summit of Kala Patthar, you get to enjoy the 
                    360-degree panorama of the high Himalayas, including Mt. Everest, Nuptse, Pumori, and Changtse.
                    
                    After conquering the foothills of the Himalayas, you'll retrace the rugged route back to Lukla to conclude the Everest Base Camp Trek.
